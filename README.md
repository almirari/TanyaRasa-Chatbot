# TanyaRasa: Mental Health First Aid Chatbot

TanyaRasa is an Indonesian-language mental health chatbot designed to provide psychological first aid through accurate intent classification using fine-tuned **IndoBERT**. Developed as a final project for the Text Mining Course at Institut Teknologi Sepuluh Nopember (ITS), TanyaRasa aims to assist users in identifying their emotional states and providing empathetic responses.

## ðŸ§© Project Summary

This project focuses on building an NLP-based chatbot capable of:

- Understanding Indonesian mental health conversations
- Accurately classifying user intent (e.g., anxiety, stress, depression)
- Generating appropriate responses for psychological first aid
- Being deployed in an interactive web interface via Streamlit

Two models were evaluated:
- **IndoBERT** (better classification accuracy)
- **CENDOL** (tested for classification & generative capabilities)

## Features

- Intent classification using fine-tuned **IndoBERT**
- Preprocessing with stemming, stopword removal, and lowercasing
- Trained on translated Kaggle mental health datasets
- Deployed with Streamlit and Hugging Face
- Includes confidence thresholding and fallback mechanisms
